Smosh is a longstanding YouTube empire comprised of three channels - Smosh, Smosh Pit, and Smosh Games - founded in 2005 by longtime friends Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla.

Over the years, each channel has seen times of significant growth and decline, mostly relating to content and casting changes. At this current point in time (February 2024), the Smosh cast is comprised of 15 recurring, revolving individuals from all kinds of backgrounds - actors, improvisors, directors, writers, editors, etc., who are in front of the camera. But for many people, Smosh is, at its core, Ian and Anthony.

In 2017 when Anthony left to pursue other ventures, many people marked that as the death of Smosh, a common sentiment on the internet when a founding member is no longer part of what they've created. However, in June of 2023, it was announced Anthony was returning to Smosh and that he and Ian had bought the company back, and fans could not be happier.

Here, we will look specifically at Smosh Pit and the channel growth, measured by video views, from January 2023 to January 2024. This is an interrupted time series project to determine if fan happiness translated to something beyond support on social media, and if the return of Anthony will truly be the reincarnation.
